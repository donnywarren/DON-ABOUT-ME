              <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's me, but please call me Don. My mom used to call me Curious George. I always want to know more about everything.  There never seems to be a limit to the things I want to learn.  Currently, I am very excited to dive into the ocean of knowledge available in computer science and programming.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm transitioning from retail/restaurants to tech because I want new challenges and new experiences.  I enjoyed the comradery and fast pace of the restaurant industry.  I'm looking forward to applying my nimble and adaptive work style to the ever changing tech industry.  I'm a "we can fix anything" type of person, so I believe I'm going to have a positive impact in all my future rolls.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm also curious to learn if my corny sense of humor and chatty personality will continue to help me make friends and develop strong work relationships when I'm a software engineer.  Moving to New York meant saying good-by to many friends and coworkers, but fortunately I've been able to continue mentoring and coaching from a distance.  I've always been a high achiever and always was considered the "friendliest boss I've ever had" by my teams.  The dichotomy of my personality was spotted early when my teachers complimented my top-of-the-class work and then encouraged less talk and more focus.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving to New York and starting over has been the best decision of my life.  I have always known where I wanted to live and I can't believe I waited so long to get here.  My ability to solve problems and achieve complex goals has made the transition a snap.  I love the subway, and also architecture, science fiction and dessert.  Maybe I will work on a team that designs ice cream parlors on Mars?<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently I am without social or financial obligations, therefore it's an excellent time for me to devote myself to learning software engineering.  I don't know which business or specific job title I want to land.  I do know I want to connect new services to new users by bridging the gap between technical realities and user goals.  Thanks!
